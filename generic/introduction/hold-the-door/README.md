# Hold The Door

> Prevent brute force attacks from white walkers using Hodor

## Description

In this introduction assignment; we want you to build a little extra security around WordPress. We want you to help us to prevent brute force attacks from white walkers, when they try to login to our website **The cave of the three-eyed raven**. 

To do that, we want have an extra `text field` of security to the login form when logging in or registering. And this field should simply ask `Are you Hodor?`, and with that said we want the user to input text `3 times`. The first input should be `Hold the door` (shouldn't matter if it's uppercase or lowercase), the second time `Hold door` and the third time `Hodor`. And when that is validated, the user should be able to login/register.
